 * thread whose author blocked them, replies to a comment whose author blocked them, or comments on a paste
 * (or a forum post's comment thread) whose owner blocked them. Network announces every change as
 * network.block.changed (blocker, blocked, active, a per-pair revision); ../pulse/consumer.js applies each
 * one here, keeping only the newest revision per (blocker, blocked), so a late or replayed event never
 * undoes a newer one. Moderation (hide, lock, delete, statuses) is never affected by a block.
