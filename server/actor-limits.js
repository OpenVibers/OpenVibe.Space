/**
 * Per-actor rate limits at the API routes (roadmap WS-R task 4; openvibe-sdk/limits).
 *
 * The per-address /api/ limit (app.js) and the per-person content limits (limits.js: cooldowns, writes
 * a minute) stay. These count requests by who makes them, once req.viewer is resolved:
 *
 *   a person                        user:usr_… (their own token, or named by a service or app in X-OV-Subject)
 *   a first-party service relaying  ip:<address> of the signed-out visitor it forwards (X-Forwarded-For),
 *     a signed-out visitor          as the per-address limit counts them
 *   a service or app acting as      its principal (svc:live, app:app_…): moderation and AI output
 *     itself
 *   a signed-out browser            ip:<address>
 *
 * A first-party service reading for itself (no person, no visitor) is not counted on reads: its pages
 * speak for all its visitors, and the per-address /api/ limit already bounds it. Past a limit the route
 * answers 429 problem+json `rate_limited` with Retry-After before it does any work; the refusal is
 * logged once and counted in space_rate_limited_total{limit,window}. Reads get SPACE_LIMITS_MINUTE
 * / SPACE_LIMITS_HOUR (120 and 3000); writes set their own numbers where they are mounted. Counters
 * live in this process: a restart forgets them.
 *
 * Never limited: /api/health, /api/ready, /release.json, /metrics, and the signed Events deliveries
 * (/internal/events: Events pushes at its own pace, and a 429 would only make it retry and fall behind;
 * they also carry token cutoffs and account deletions). Pages keep their per-address form limits.
